a data structure is a way to store
and organize data in a computer, so that 
it can be used efficiently

we will talk about them in 2 ways
      1 - mathematical / logical models
              abastract data types == ADT
                example: list
                  - store a given number of elements of any type
                  - read elements by position
                  - modify element at a position
              concreate implementation of a list => array                    
      2 - Implementation
          an implementation of the array => linked list
      ADT's - define data and operations, but do not have implementation details
Discussed in 4 ways:
      logical view
      operations
      cost of operations
      Implementation in a coding language
