    <h1>The United States</h1>
    <h3>20TH CENTURY USA</h3>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the early 20th century three new states were
      admitted to the union, Oklahoma in 1907 and Arizona and New Mexico in
      1912.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also in the early 20th century the USA built the
      Panama Canal. President Theodore Roosevelt decided to build a canal across
      Panama in 1902. In 1903 the USA leased a 6-mile wide canal zone for 99
      years. The canal was built in the years 1904-1914.
    </p>
    <h3>THE USA IN THE FIRST WORLD WAR</h3>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the First World War began in 1914 the USA
      remained neutral. However, Germany alienated American public opinion on 7
      May 1915 when a German submarine sank the Cunard liner Lusitania, without
      warning. Among the 1,198 people killed were 128 Americans. Nevertheless,
      Woodrow Wilson fought the 1916 election partly on the slogan 'he kept us
      out of the war'.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 6 April 1917 the USA declared war on Germany.
      America had a strong navy but a relatively small army. However,
      conscription was introduced and the USA began to raise a huge army. The
      first US troops were sent to France in June 1917, but it was the spring of
      1918 before large numbers arrived. By September the US commander General
      John J. Pershing was able to begin an offensive against the Germans. In
      September 1918 US troops destroyed a German salient at St Mihiel. They
      then launched an attack on the Meuse-Argonne area. German troops were
      pushed back until Germany surrendered on 11 November 1918.
    </p>
    <h3>THE 1920s</h3>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For most people (not all) the 1920s were a time of
      prosperity. In 1912 only 16% of homes had electric light. By 1927 it had
      risen to 63%. Electrical appliances became common, refrigerators, irons
      and fans. Radios also became common. By 1930 40% of homes had one. Cars
      also became common in the 1920s. Americans enjoyed the highest standard of
      living in the world.
