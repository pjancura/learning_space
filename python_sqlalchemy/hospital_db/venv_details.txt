to start virtual environment:

    'source .venv_hospital_db/bin/activate'

end virtual environment:

    'deactivate'

this virtual environment was created with the following commands:

    'python3.13 -m venv .venv_hospital_db'
    'source .venv_hospital_db/bin/activate'
    'python3 -m pip install sqlalchemy mysql-connector-python'


OTHER NOTES:

I had to run the following SQL command:
    'GRANT CREATE, ALTER, DROP, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, SELECT, REFERENCES, RELOAD on *.* TO 'pj'@'localhost' WITH GRANT OPTION;'
in order for my user to be able to connect / create the hospital_1 db.

display the current user in the mysql terminal:
    'SHOW user();'

adding a table with a foreignKey constraint:
    add the MetaData of the table to the script that will create the new table  
    access the column like an object 
        'table_name.c.column_name'

when making SELECT queries:
    if the query returns more than 1 column, use execute(stmt) NOT scalars(stmt)
    scalars(stmt) is meant to be used only with a classes __repr__ method
